# GPU compression algorithm
In each thread, check random number generator seed and for each thread find random word in dictionary for each word in text. Random words should not match word at given position, so each thread will narrow the scope of possible words that matche the given word. Narrowing is also done by limiting random word choices to those that haven't followed the previous word previously in the text
